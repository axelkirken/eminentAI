Staff was really friendly too!", "Amazing view and nice options for lunch.Really relaxing place next to water.", "Being here in a sunny warm day is hardily possible to make a bad review. The view is awesome, the stuff is friendly and there are a good amount of options in the menu. I can recommend the Caesar Salad and the Grilled Croissant.

The managers were watching us, probably us not being Swedes, they had a sarcastic attitude towards me when trying to go back to the restaurant and had a very unpolite approach when a colleague tried to serve us outside the restaurant with some home baked cookies. I recommend managers to hang an announcement \"Non-Swedes not welcome!\". For confirmation, as well as for apologies, I am available. Otherwise, the staff is very nice and the food is good.

(Discovered at home)\n\n\u2796 The cardamom bun tasted like air, amazing when a bakery makes these?\n\n\u2796The salad was tasteless, would have just as easily eaten grass on the ground that would have tasted better.\n\n\u2796When I went to pick up the food, they say I should pick up 5 dishes..\n\nThey have no idea what people order, stressed and messy.\n\nAbsolutely deplorable that they don't listen to customers and charge for things you didn't order.\n\nParking is incredibly hard to come by.\n\nWon't be coming back.\n\nVERY DISSATISFIED!", "A fantastically beautiful brick building with several small rooms where you can sit close to nature outside the window with a lake view. Fantastic home-baked sourdough bread, cakes and buns are served here. Now during the summer months there are many lovely little sitting areas under the trees with the forest close in. The waterworks is located right on Lake Kapplasj\u00f6n where you can see and hear the splashing of people bathing.", "Very cozy place that is a bit hidden on Liding\u00f6. Close to the water, many seats both inside and outside. Nice staff who worked :) we bought quinoa salad with chicken feta and avocado and a grilled ciabatta with avocado/chicken, however, the ciabatta was quite tasteless, but it was solved with a little salt and pepper. Next time it will be salad with ch\u00e8vre & spinach toast (this one looked really good)! We also bought buns to take home, but they weren't baked enough, so we put them in the oven for a few minutes and it was perfect!\nThe iced coffee was now suitable for the summer \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nRecommended!\n\nThe place can also be rented for private events.", "What a place, one of the coziest cafes I've been to in a long time, great, happy, friendly and welcoming staff who really chatted and told nice things about the waterworks. Fun interior was in green brown and New Age, you felt at home. Beautiful outdoor seating. Super nice bread with more butter in the buns than anything else, my companion enjoyed the blueberry bun full of cream and tartness. My chocolate chip was a bit hard and sad but good.\n\nBasically everything was right, and not because there was anything wrong with the preparation of the latte (perhaps the knife and scale for the grinder should be adjusted) but it tasted far too little caffe for a full pot.\n\nThank you for a lovely coffee\n\n20220703\nStill the same nice place, we were both at 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock, it was noticeable that the Service team had a lot to do and started to do a little worse work, and so the alleri folder needs to be updated, I refrained from testing something that looked good, because he needed to call and the line was too long.", "Wonderful place next to Kottlasj\u00f6n on Liding\u00f6. Freshly baked bread for sale, coffee, lunch - everything to the highest standard. Nice walking paths in L\u00e5ng\u00e4ngen-Elfviks Nature Reserve.

Of course I thought it just happened to go wrong until I read the comments of others below who \"happened\" to the same mistake. Not okay and want to warn others.", "Plus for very nice location by the water and nice renovation. Beautiful walking paths. Cozy little playhouses for the children. Could be really good for a party. Poppis for dog owners.\n\nMinus for the food, the food selection, the service and the coffee. There you need to make more of an effort. If you don't like barking dogs (80% have dogs and they tend to bark without the owner noticing) it also ends up on the minus list.", "What a gem!! Super nice staff despite full roll and lots of people. Very good salads, sandwiches with salad. But the cinnamon buns are amazingly fresh and good, next time I'm going to pop them. Many different seats both inside and outside, by the water or a little above. Fits great if the doggie is with you.", "Such a nice cafe, and a nice swimming area, but my gluten allergic son got so sick after eating a gluten-free cake there. Perhaps gluten-free enough for those who avoid gluten but not at all for those with allergies. (Which they said would be safe when I asked)", "Cozy cafe or place for lunch. Been here many times and am always equally satisfied with the visit. Good buns and good dishes. Feel free to combine with a lap around Kottla on a sunny day. Dogs are not welcome indoors but of course outdoors.", "Cozy place, good coffee...but don't visit the toilet \ud83e\udd22horribly dirty. Hope the kitchen and bakery are cleaned better \u2026", "Very nice place. I had my dog with me and sat in their nice garden. Good coffee and really good pastries! Lots of people in the middle of the day on a Monday! Quiet and close to the lake, in the forest! Good with seats and not crowded. Maybe not the cheapest place, hence not full 5 \u2606.", "The setting is magnificent, the food is good. You can access it in winter via the frozen lake, which makes the adventure even more magical! The waiters are very friendly, you can even sit in a lounge alone or in a group with a view of the lake.", "What a hidden gem in the middle of the forest and such good quinoa kale and hot salmon salad we also ate!

Wonderful location and best levain and French pastries on the island.", "OK. The outdoor seating, which faces the lake, is in the shade all day, except after closing. Bit of a shame.\n\nInside, the ceiling is high, it could be a little cozier.", "Pleasant environment. Fresh dishes and freshly baked buns. I will be back.", "Nice atmosphere and good food/coffee.", "Always good coffee and cozy place. Today, however, it was one of the staff (of an older model) who must have woken up on the wrong side. He was snooty and unpleasant. Many guests reacted to his annoying/stressful way of dealing with guests.", "Good bread, good coffee, friendly staff in an environment that beats most."]
